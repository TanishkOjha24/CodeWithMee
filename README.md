## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* A free [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account
* A [Google AI API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/) for Gemini
* A [YouTube Data API v3 Key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com)

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    Clone the project to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/TanishkOjha24/CodeWithMee002.git](https://github.com/TanishkOjha24/CodeWithMee002.git)
    cd CodeWithMee002
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    You'll need to install dependencies for both the `server` and the `client`.

    ```bash
    # Install server dependencies
    cd server
    npm install

    # Install client dependencies
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**

    The backend requires secret keys to connect to the database and external APIs.

    1.  Navigate to the `server` directory.
    2.  Create a new file named `.env`.
    3.  Add the following variables to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual keys:

        ```
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=a_long_and_random_secret_string_for_jwt
        GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
        YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_data_api_key
        ```

        **Note:** It is crucial that these keys are kept private and that the `.env` file is never committed to Git.

4.  **Run the Application**

    You need to start both the backend server and the frontend client in separate terminals.

    * **To start the server:**
        ```bash
        cd server
        npm start
        ```
        The server will be running on `http://localhost:5001`.

    * **To start the client:**
        ```bash
        cd client
        npm start
        ```
        The React application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
